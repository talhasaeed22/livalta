We are all facing the protein challenge: feed a growing population while preserving our planet. At Livalta, we see this as the protein opportunity: using science and technology to develop and produce sustainable, high- quality, protein-rich ingredients for feed and food. And we always demand more: Our products offer additional functional properties, to support wellbeing and performance of animals.

## What is ProtoCell?

Our ProtoCell is a functional and circular protein, highly suitable for the <strong>nutritional needs of piglets</strong>. Carefully developed from corn-based bioethanol co-product streams, it contains soluble and highly available corn protein (70%) together with yeast cells (30%), using an innovative, patented process. This provides a perfect synergy of plant protein and yeast, with nutritional and functional benefits.

## Why did we make it?

ProtoCell is the result of years of research and development, deep-rooted technical knowledge, and a commitment to finding responsibly sourced, scalable alternatives to conventional protein-rich ingredients and to securing a sustainable future for the agri-food industry. ProtoCell is manufactured in a controlled environment; ProtoCell comes with the highest quality and traceability standards and is assured under recognised feed safety certification schemes.

## What are the benefits for you and your piglets?

ProtoCell is a <strong>cost-efficient and sustainable alternative</strong> to animal or plant-based proteins protein ingredients bringing together the nutritional benefits of plant protein and the functional benefits of yeast.
