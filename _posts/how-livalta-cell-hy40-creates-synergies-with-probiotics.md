<h2>1+1 = 3: How Livalta&trade;Cell HY40 creates synergies with probiotics</h2>

Probiotics are known for having a whole host of benefits when fed to animals, including positive effects on the microbiome; support for healthy development and productivity; and they can help provide protection against pathogens. But in the real world, it’s not always easy to achieve those positive effects. One factor that will make a difference is the probiotic microorganism’s ability to cope with the challenging conditions found in the animal’s gut, such as a low gastric pH. Sometimes, they need help!

We know what <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong>, our enzymatically treated yeast derived from selected non-GM <i>saccharomyces cerevisiae strains</i>, can do on its own: it combines the nutritional and functional benefits of yeast and nurtures and protects the animal. It can be an element of a strategy to support reducing antibiotics. But what if we combined <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong> with probiotics? Could there be synergies: 1+1 = 3?

To test this, we carried out an in vitro trial with <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong> and the probiotic <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> is, also known as the hay bacillus or grass bacillus, widely used to enhance animal fibre digestion and gut health. We placed bacteria on a 'growth medium':

<ul>
  <li>Group A: Growth medium supplemented with 0.1 % glucose as a carbon source</li>
  <li>Group B: Growth medium supplemented with 0.1%  <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong></li>
</ul>

…and then simulated a low pH stress by pre-treating two additional groups with hydrochloric acid, setting the pH to 2.0 and incubating the bacteria for 30 min at 37°C following Sumeri et al., 2010.

<ul>
  <li>Group C: Growth medium supplemented with 0.1 % glucose + low pH stress</li>
  <li>Group D: Growth medium supplemented with 0.1% <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong> + low pH stress.</li>
</ul>

We monitored the growth of the bacteria across the 4 groups spectrophotometrically for 24 hours using an automated growth analyser.

Figure 1. Growth curves of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> cultures in growth media containing either 0.1% glucose or 0.1% <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong>, with or without low pH stress
So what did we see? Our results summarized in the graph above show that

<ul>
    <li>without low pH stress, <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong> can help to support the growth of the probiotic <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, especially during early stages</li>
    <li>under low pH stress, <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong> can help to optimise the resilience and support the growth of the bacteria </li>
</ul>

So there are potential synergies: <strong>Livalta&trade;Cell HY40</strong> can help to support the growth of probiotic bacteria and protect them under the difficult conditions in the gut of the animal. 1+1 = 3.
