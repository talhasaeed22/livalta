Livalta’s core competence lies in the development and production of high-quality protein-rich ingredients. But we always demand more: Our products offer additional functional properties, to support optimal health, wellbeing and performance. 

For ProtoCell, we turn co-products from the corn-based bioethanol industry into a circular, new generation functional protein. ProtoCell contains soluble and highly available corn protein (70%) and yeast cells (30%), recovered using our innovative, patented separation process. This provides a perfect synergy of plant protein and yeast, with nutritional and functional benefits.

For aquaculture – including fish and shrimp – ProtoCell is a responsible, circular and economical alternative to high value proteins such as fishmeal. ProtoCell is consistent in quality and manufactured to the highest standards. And we have developed it with animal performance and well-being in mind and environmental protection at its core.
